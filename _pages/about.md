I am a theater maker/arts worker/educator based in Chicago. Currently I am the Artistic Director of [The Neo-Futurists](https://www.neofuturists.org/), where I have created and premiered new work since 2018.

My primary practice is ensemble-generated new works rooted in the lived experiences of the performers. I emphasize movement, social engagement, and live music to create dynamic, provocative experiences.

As a committed DIY creative, I also work in film, music, photography, digital design, and print.
